# SnakeGame
It demonstrates various programming concepts such as linked lists, memory management, console interaction, and game logic.
The game showcases how user input is used to control the snake's movement, how collisions are detected, how the snake's body is 
managed using a linked list, and how the game state is updated in a loop.

The code you provided is an implementation of the classic Snake game using the C++ programming language. 
I'll break down the code step by step and explain its different components.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <Windows.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <conio.h>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std;
```

This section includes necessary header files for various functionalities used in the program, such as handling console 
output, memory management, keyboard input, and time functions.

```cpp
struct Body
{
    int x;
    int y;

    Body *next;
} *head, *tail;
```

Here, a struct named `Body` is defined to represent each segment of the snake's body. It contains `x` and `y`
coordinates to store the position of the segment on the game grid. The `next` pointer is used to create a linked list
of body segments. Two pointers `head` and `tail` are used to manage the linked list.

```cpp
int Map[40][120];

int sizeX = 90;
int sizeY = 20;
int score = 0;
int xFood = 4;
int yFood = 10;
```

A 2D array `Map` is used to represent the game grid. `sizeX` and `sizeY` define the dimensions of the grid.
`score` keeps track of the player's score, and `xFood` and `yFood` store the coordinates of the food that the snake
needs to eat.

```cpp
void createBody(int x, int y)
{
    Body *body = (Body *)malloc(sizeof(Body));
    body->x = x;
    body->y = y;
    if (!head)
    {
        head = tail = body;
    }
    else
    {
        tail->next = body;
        tail = body;
    }
    tail->next = NULL;
}
```

The `createBody` function is used to create a new segment in the snake's body and add it to the linked list. 
Memory is allocated for the new segment using `malloc`. If the snake's body is empty, `head` and `tail` are set to the new 
segment. Otherwise, the new segment is added to the end of the linked list.

```cpp
void gotoxy(int x, int y)
{
    COORD c = {x, y};
    SetConsoleCursorPosition(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), c);
}
```

The `gotoxy` function is used to position the cursor on the console screen to the specified `x` and `y` coordinates.
This is used to print characters at specific positions on the screen.

```cpp
void createMap()
{
    // Initialize the game map with walls and empty spaces
    // (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `createMap` function initializes the game map with walls and empty spaces. 
This function is not provided in the code snippet, but it's implied to set up the initial game environment.

```cpp
void createFood()
{
    // Generate and place food on the map
    // (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `createFood` function generates random coordinates for the food and places it on the map. 
Similar to `createMap`, the implementation details are not provided in the code snippet.

```cpp
void viewMap()
{
    // Display the game map on the console
    // (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `viewMap` function displays the current state of the game map on the console.
It prints walls, the snake's body segments, and the food.

```cpp
bool run(int x, int y)
{
    // Move the snake and handle collisions
    // (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `run` function updates the snake's position based on the specified `x` and `y` changes. 
It also handles collisions with walls, the snake's body, and food. This function is a critical part of the game's logic.

```cpp
void play()
{
    // Game loop
    // (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `play` function is the main game loop where player input is processed, and the game mechanics are executed. 
It utilizes the `run` function to update the game state.

```cpp
void popAll()
{
    // Deallocate memory for the linked list
    // (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `popAll` function deallocates memory for all the segments in the linked list when the game is over.

```cpp
int main()
{
    // Game initialization and main loop
    // (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. 
It initializes the game, processes user input for starting and exiting the game, and manages the overall game flow.

Please note that the code you provided is a partial snippet, and some parts of the implementation are omitted for brevity.
The omitted parts likely include key game logic, such as handling user input and updating the game state, which are crucial
for the game to function properly.
